## Short Description (132 characters max)
Enable NVIDIA RTX Super Resolution for video streaming services to enhance video quality in fullscreen mode.

## Detailed Description (16,000 characters max)

RTX Video Enhancer enables high-quality upscaling when watching videos in fullscreen mode on streaming platforms, particularly on high-resolution displays where standard upscaling quality may be insufficient. The extension leverages NVIDIA RTX Super Resolution's AI-powered upscaling technology to maintain superior video quality.

KEY FEATURES:
- Automatic activation in fullscreen mode
- Works with major streaming services worldwide  
- Lightweight with minimal performance impact
- Simple on/off toggle via extension icon
- No configuration required
- No data collection or tracking

REQUIREMENTS:
- NVIDIA RTX Graphics Card (RTX 20/30/40 series)
- Latest NVIDIA drivers (526.98+) with RTX Super Resolution support
- Microsoft Windows 10/11
- Google Chrome with hardware acceleration enabled

HOW IT WORKS:
The extension adds a minimal overlay element to video players that triggers NVIDIA's RTX Super Resolution when videos are played in fullscreen mode. This is especially beneficial on high-resolution displays where native upscaling quality may be inadequate, allowing the RTX GPU to provide superior video enhancement in real-time.

PRIVACY:
The extension operates entirely locally with no data collection, external communication, or user tracking. It only stores your enable/disable preference locally on your device.
